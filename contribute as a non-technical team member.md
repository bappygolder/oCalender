# Contribute as a non-technical team member

Our first few users who motivated us to carry was our closest family members and friends. Most of whom weren't technical, yet they made a huge impact. If you want to help out in some ways great, please give us a call. Even if you just want to say hello that will motivates us. 

We always need non technical team members who can give us a new perspective on things, help us with documentations etc. If you want to get involved but don't have any perticular tech skill, don't worry just give us a call and we'll find someway to intigrat you to oTask productivity family :)
